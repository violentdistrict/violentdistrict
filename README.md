  im like. too lazy to pretty up this up but c*h is okay, idgaf unless im with my partner or friends i guessss, idk it depends on if i feel like specifying that im not okay with cuddling EXCEPT FOR MY BUDDIES you guys have a special place in my heart ok... sign my ata if you want i dont really care
  also im offtab/offwindow a lot because im doing stuff duh what did you expect! it would be better if you whisper me instead rather than publicly talking to me (unless friends/moots), im usually just ingame to accompany my friends there or participate in events
